        <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking (visibility) of a website in search engines. The higher (or more frequently) a web site is displayed in a search engine list (like Google), the more visitors it is expected to receive.</p>

    <p>Adaptive web design is a process of server-side detection that chooses a design layout and size to display. All types of web design layouts can be used, including responsive layout (although responsive web design usually allows for all the control of Adaptive Web Design, without the need to edit multiple pages on updates).</p>

    <h2>Higher sales conversion</h2>

    <p>Research also concludes that around 10% is a good sales conversion rate with the average conversion rate across industries being 2.5%.

        But how you calculate your sales conversion rate also plays an essential role here. This could be the sales you make divided by the total number of visitors you get and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.
        
        So if you got, say 100 visitors a month and made 20 sales, your conversion rate would be 20/100 x 100 giving you 20% conversion rate. However, our survey showed that only about 10% of the respondents calculate their sales conversion rate using this tactic.</p>
